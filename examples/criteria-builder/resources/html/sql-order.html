<p>CriteriaBuilder allows you to influence the order of store/collection results in a very SQL-like way:</p>
<pre>
ORDER BY {propertyName} {direction [ASC/DESC]}

SELECT orderNumber
ORDER BY orderDate DESC
</pre>

<h2>Multiple Order By</h2>
<p>Multiple sorters can be added by providing a comma-delimited list of property/direction combinations:</p>
<pre>
ORDER BY {propertyName} {direction [ASC/DESC]}, {propertyName} {direction [ASC/DESC]}, ...

SELECT orderNumber
JOIN user u
ORDER BY orderDate DESC, u.lastName ASC
</pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As with joins and criteria, sorting on association fields will require the inclusion of the join alias in the property name (see above).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
var cb = new CriteriaBuilder.Builder({
    store: mystore
});
var sql = 'select u.lastName, orderId, orderNumber num join user u order by orderDate DESC, u.lastName ASC';
// run
cb.query({sql:sql});
</pre>
