<p>This example demonstrates using CriteriaBuilder's DSL to query of a data set. In this case, we have an Order, which is made by a User. We'd like to filter this data by orders placed between 2001 and 2012. We also want to sort the result by the User's last name, and limit the result set to 5 records.</p>
<pre>
var store = btn.up('grid').getStore(),
    cb = store.newCriteriaBuilder();
// use the DSL
cb.join('user', 'u')
  .between('orderDate', '2001-01-01', '2012-01-01')
  .limit(5)
  .order('u.lastName', 'ASC');
// run the query
var data = cb.query({type:'filter'});
</pre>
