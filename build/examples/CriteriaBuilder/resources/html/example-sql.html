<p>This example demonstrates a simple SQL-like query of a data set. In this case, we have an Order, which is made by a User, who has an Address. We'd like to filter this data by Users who have a last name which begins with an "R" and whose Address has the fragment "Ave" in it. We also want to sort the result by the User's last name.</p>
<pre>
var store = btn.up('grid').getStore(),
    sql = 'join user u join address a on user where u.lastName like "R%" and a.address like "%Ave%" order by u.lastName DESC';
// clear the filter first
store.clearFilter();
// run filterBySql
store.filterBySql(sql);
</pre>
